Briefly summarize your client, Artemis Financial, and its software requirements. Who was the client? What issue did the company want you to address? 
Artemis Financial is a financial services company that handles sensitive data and transactions. Their primary concern was ensuring that their software applications adhered to security best practices to protect against vulnerabilities that could be exploited by attackers. The company tasked us with conducting a vulnerability assessment and recommending improvements for secure coding practices. 
What did you do well when you found your client’s software security vulnerabilities? Why is it important to code securely? What value does software security add to a company’s overall well-being? 
I excelled in identifying critical vulnerabilities within the code, such as weaknesses in encryption implementation and potential injection points. Secure coding is essential because it reduces the risk of exploits, protecting both the company and its customers from potential breaches. Strong software security practices enhance a company’s reputation and prevent financial and legal repercussions. 
Which part of the vulnerability assessment was challenging or helpful to you? 
The most challenging aspect of the assessment was prioritizing which vulnerabilities to address first. With limited resources, it was crucial to identify which risks posed the most immediate threats. However, this challenge was also beneficial because it taught me to think critically about risk management. 
How did you increase layers of security? In the future, what would you use to assess vulnerabilities and decide which mitigation techniques to use? 
I implemented multiple layers of security, including stronger encryption (SHA-256) and secure communications (HTTPS) to protect data in transit. In the future, I would continue to use automated tools like OWASP Dependency-Check, manual code reviews, and threat modeling to assess vulnerabilities and decide on the best mitigation strategies.
How did you make certain the code and software application were functional and secure? After refactoring the code, how did you check to see whether you introduced new vulnerabilities? 
After refactoring the code, I ran a series of automated tests, including both unit and integration tests, to ensure that the functionality was intact. Additionally, I performed manual reviews to check for common vulnerabilities.
What resources, tools, or coding practices did you use that might be helpful in future assignments or tasks? 
I used tools such as OWASP Dependency-Check, Maven, and the Java Keytool to manage security aspects. Coding practices like input validation, secure data handling, and regular dependency checks were invaluable and will continue to be helpful in future projects.
Employers sometimes ask for examples of work that you have successfully completed to show your skills, knowledge, and experience. What might you show future employers from this assignment? 
I would showcase the secure coding practices and vulnerability assessment report as evidence of my ability to identify and mitigate software security risks. Specifically, my work with encryption protocols (SHA-256) and implementing HTTPS demonstrates my competency in building secure systems.
